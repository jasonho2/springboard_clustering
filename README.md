# springboard_clustering

This mini project from Springboard's Data Science Career Track is composed of different clustering algorithms for the purpose of customer segmentation based on their transactions and offers. The dataset used for this exercise contains information on newsletters and transaction data from customers. 

Several clustering algorithms were used with different methods for choosing the number of clusters and then evaluating the clusters based on a silhouette score.
